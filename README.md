# Hi, I'm Timothy Partee

## Welcome to my GitHub page!

Here you will find some projects I have worked on in the past or recently, and projects which I may use to collaborate with friends or use to mentor more junion engineers.

## About Me

I'm a Senior/Staff/Principal level Software Engineer/Architect with over 31 years of experience now in software lifecycle development in the full-stack. I've worked on my Web Apps, Desktop Apps/Tools and Game Apps/Tools over the years, and take a great deal of pride in doing a job well-done by creating code which is efficient, legible, extensible and intuitive.

## Current Passion

I'm super interested in AR/VR development right now since I spend a lot of time in VR social apps/games and am seeing on a daily basis how VR experiences are changing the lives and patterns of people all over the world. I'm currently pursuing positions in the AR/VR domain putting the skills I have kept honed for the last many years to use in crafting excellent XR user experiences.

## Past Passions

In the past I've enjoyed working on a lot of different "cool" technologies and built some interesting apps and tools. I've done a lot of work with Data Visualization over the years (rendering charts, graphs, animations, and a lot more) which is something I really enjoy doing. I've also done a lot of work in the HCI (Human Computer Interface) world, including building prototypes of new or experimental hardware meant to explore improving human interaction with computers (think experimental mice, keyboards, controllers and other doodads). Another personal passion of mine which continues today is good User Experience, I think if people are going to interact with machines that interaction should be natural, intuitive, easy and accessible. Finally I feel like if you're going to write software that isn't entertaining, then it should at least boost productivity or be useful - software development is most rewarding when people have reason to love what your software does for them.

## Technologies

I work with an expansive number of technologies and consider myself to be more of a "jack of all trades" rather than a subject matter expert on any one technology or framework. I like to think I'm adaptible to jump into almost any project, language or framework and get a lot done quickly!

Here's some of the tech I work with regularly:

- Desktop Development: C#, WPF, XAML, Xamarin, C/C++, Qt, .Net 4.x, .Net 5.x, .Net Core, Mono, Unity, UnityXR, OpenXR, XRI
- Web Development: JavaScript/TypeScript, NodeJS, AngularJS, Angular, React, HTML5, CSS3, Three.js, D3, WebGL, WebXR, PHP, Perl, CodeIgniter, Laravel
- Data Management/Science: MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, Redis, ElastiCache, ElastiSearch, Oracle/SuiteQL, SalesForce/SOQL
- Infrastructure: Git, SVN, Docker, YAML, Linux, Windows, etc. etc.

## Projects

If you'd like to use any of my projects for yourself, please feel free to do so but credit portions of your work back to me please! If there's anything you can learn from my projects, then they were worth posting here!
